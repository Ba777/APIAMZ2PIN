App for automating Affiliate marketing between amazon and pinterest


This app was created as a script that can run continuously, drawing words from a dictionary, 
searching amazon for items that match those words, then creating an affiliate marketing post
using the pinterest API, which will direct pinterest users back the amazon listing.
The commission on sales goes to your personal account.
